CZGSpinLayer
============

CZGSpinLayer is a cocos2d CCLayer subclass that allows you to have a spinning "wheel" like interaction.  

I pulled this class out of the game QatQi - this is what was used to create the spinning main menu, as well as the spinning graph on the stats page.

To use CZGSpinLayer, you will need to have cocos2d installed in your project as a cocoapod.  If you're not already using cocos2d that way, then you should set up a pod file for it, do pod install, then remove the cocos2d files that were previously in your project.

For sample code, see the HelloWorldLayer.m file in the sample project.
